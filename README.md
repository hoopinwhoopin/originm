# Image Processing and Measurement Tool

This project is a full-stack application designed to simplify image manipulation, DICOM image parsing, and real-world measurement conversions. It features an intuitive UI and supports both light and dark themes, catering specifically to the needs of medical imaging.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

### 1. **Image Manipulation**
Perform transformations such as brightness adjustments, zooming, and panning. It uses high-performance canvas rendering for smooth operations.

### 2. **DICOM Image Parsing**
Upload and view DICOM (.dcm) files, extract relevant metadata (e.g., patient name, study date), and display them alongside the image.

### 3. **Real-World Measurement Conversion**
Accurately convert pixel distances into real-world units (e.g., millimeters, centimeters) using configurable pixel spacing or scaling factors.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Konva.js (for canvas-based rendering)
